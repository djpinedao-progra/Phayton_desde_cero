# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This codebase consists of simple Python scripts for introductory programming tasks. Each file is a standalone script, typically focused on a single function or demonstration. There is no complex architecture or inter-file dependency.

## Key Files
- `cal.py`: Likely contains calculator-related logic or functions.
- `calculadora.py`: Spanish for "calculator"; may contain similar or extended calculator logic.
- `hola_mundo.py`: "Hello World" demonstration, usually the simplest Python script.
- `mi_perfil.py`: "My Profile"; likely contains code for displaying or managing user profile information.
- `saludo.py`: "Greeting"; likely contains code for printing or handling greetings.

## Patterns and Conventions
- Each script is self-contained and does not import from others.
- File names are in Spanish, reflecting the educational context.
- Scripts are likely used for learning basic Python concepts (I/O, functions, variables).
- No external dependencies or package management (no requirements.txt or setup.py).
- No test framework or build system is present; scripts are run directly with Python.

## Developer Workflow
- To run a script: `python <filename>.py`
- No build or test commands are required.
- Debugging is done by running scripts and observing output/errors.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Focus on clarity and simplicity in code suggestions.
- Use Spanish for comments and variable names to match existing conventions.
- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity or external dependencies.
- When adding new scripts, follow the pattern of one main function per file.
- If expanding functionality, keep each script independent unless explicitly requested otherwise.

## Example
To add a new script for summing two numbers:

```python
# suma.py
# Script para sumar dos números

a = int(input("Ingrese el primer número: "))
b = int(input("Ingrese el segundo número: "))
print("La suma es:", a + b)
```

If you add new conventions or workflows, update this file to keep instructions current.
